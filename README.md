## Description

A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is a type of generative model used in unsupervised learning, particularly in the domain of deep learning and neural networks. The primary purpose of a VAE is to model the underlying distribution of input data, enabling the generation of new samples that resemble the training data.

## Key Concepts:
**Encoder-Decoder Architecture:**
A VAE consists of an encoder and a decoder, forming an autoencoder structure. The encoder maps input data into a latent space, where each dimension represents a feature.

**Latent Space:**
The latent space is a lower-dimensional representation where data is assumed to follow a certain distribution (often Gaussian). It allows for efficient sampling and interpolation between data points.

**Variational Inference:**
VAEs use variational inference to estimate the posterior distribution of the latent space. This involves introducing a probabilistic element to the model, making it stochastic.

**Reparameterization Trick:**
To make backpropagation feasible in a stochastic model, the reparameterization trick is employed. It involves sampling from a simple distribution (e.g., Gaussian) and transforming the sample into the desired distribution.
